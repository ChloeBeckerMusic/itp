### REFLECTION:

##### Problems faced, decisions made:

We were a bit stuck when trying to figure out how to split everything up so that the workload was as even as it could be, but we eventually decided that Danny would start on the html, Alicia would start on the CSS, Jihae would start on finding images, and I would start on the descriptions. Then it ended up that I found an image, and began working on the song parody and Jihae found a couple other images and started working on the descriptions. 

##### A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group:

I think I contributed a good amount; I helped move things along especially in the beginning by getting Jihae up to speed, I helped Danny along with where to start with the html, I thought of the band name and decided on the parody song. I'd say that my biggest contribution was the parody song, which I made in Ableton after grabbing an a cappella clip of someone singing "The Black Parade" with the lyrics being changed to be about their cat, then added a couple drum loops, messed with the tempo to make things fit together, sliced the a cappella to make things fit, cut down the run time of the song to keep people interested, added cat meowing samples, added a bunch of audio effects, and then sent off the .wav file to Danny. It sounds awful and is so fun and I think it adds a lot to our website. 

##### Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made:

I think we all did a great job to be honest, which rarely happens in a group project. Jihae did a great job with the descriptions ---even if they were from ChatGPT, there were a lot of descriptions and we couldn't have done it without her, and she also found some great images! Danny did a great job getting the html all set up for Alicia and made a great base for people to work off of. I helped a lot with the creative direction of the project, and created the song which is a big focal point on the website, and Alicia was really the MPV by using CSS and HTML to make the website look GORGEOUS and putting everything together in the end.
