# Homework Week #3 *Supplemental*

This week, I was humbled by my difficulties with Terminal and my lack of coherent notes from our last class. I am usually a better note taker but things must have gotten away from me, and therefore I struggled a bit with this homework, but I am **determined** ~~to be good at this immediately.~~ to learn as much as I can and do everything to the best of my ability. 

#### Here's what I did: 

1. I found a short poem! **(This is backstory stuff that I am using as an excuse to practice my skills with TextMate so you don't have to read all this)**
    * I wanted something just a bit creepy since I'm listening to *The Magnus Archives* and I thought it would be a fun opportunity to make my computer say something a bit spooky and have it be a reference to that podcast. So I remembered that in the 85th episode, there's a guy who gets haunted / hunted (either works) by literally the fear of madness- that the world isn't right and that your mind is lying to you. There's a poem that the statement giver reads that I thought would be absolutely perfect for this assignment. It's called *Antagonish* and it was written by William Hughes Mearns in 1899- it goes as follows: 
	
	
	> As I was going up the stair / I met a man who wasn't there! / He wasn't there again today, / Oh how I wish he'd go away!
	
    > When I came home last night at three / The man was waiting there for me / But when I looked around the hall, / I couldn't see him there at all!

    > Go away, go away, don't you come back any more! / Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door...

    > Last night I saw upon the stair, / A little man who wasn't there, / He wasn't there again today / Oh, how I wish he'd go away...
	

    * ...Creepy right? Anyway, that's how I decded on the poem, and then since you wanted it to be quite short, I only used the first stanza in my .aiff file. 
	
	
2. Using Terminal!
    * Wow! A week feels really long when you don't review notes until the night before something is due! ~~I'm not like this usually, I swear~~ So I looked back at my notes, found very few things to be helpful, then looked at GitHub, found very helpful information, and started troubleshooting. First, I didn't know how to save files to this specific folder, and after getting a vague idea of how to do it from my notes and beginning to troubleshoot - I knew it had something to do with using 'cd' and then telling the computer exactly which files to go to, but I forgot the format that it needed to be in - I went right to google and asked how to tell terminal where to save my files [here.](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5757659?sortBy=rank)
	* After that, I looked at the only helpful part of my notes from last class for this HW assignment, which was the format for how to make the computer say something, and was able to plug everything in! 
	* Honestly, I was expecting many many many things to go wrong, but when I went to my Haiku folder, everything was there! 
	
	
3. Determined to make a pretty TextMate window 
    * After this, I decided to make sure I felt comfortable with TextMate by making sure it looked structured and well thought out. So I went to GitHub and found a very convenient TextMate Cheatsheet, and was off to the races (especially after looking into John Gruber's original spec). Hopefully my work paid off and this looks somewhat presentable!
