# Homework Week #3 *Supplemental*

This week, I was humbled by my lack of coherent notes from our last class, so doing this homework was less seamless than I had hoped. I am usually a better note taker but things must have gotten away from me, and therefore I struggled a bit with this homework, but I am **determined** ~~to be good at this immediately.~~ to learn as much as I can and do everything to the best of my ability. 

#### Here's what I did: 

1. I found a short poem! **(This is backstory stuff that I am using as an excuse to practice my skills with TextMate so you don't have to read all this)**
    * I wanted something just a bit creepy since I'm listening to *The Magnus Archives* and I thought it would be a fun opportunity to make my computer say something a bit spooky and have it be a reference to that podcast. So I remembered that in the 85th episode, there's a guy who gets haunted / hunted (either works) by literally the fear of madness- that the world isn't right and that your mind is lying to you. There's a poem that the statement giver reads that I thought would be absolutely perfect for this assignment. It's called *Antagonish* and it was written by William Hughes Mearns in 1899- it goes as follows: 
	
	
	> As I was going up the stair / I met a man who wasn't there! / He wasn't there again today, / Oh how I wish he'd go away!
	
    > When I came home last night at three / The man was waiting there for me / But when I looked around the hall, / I couldn't see him there at all!

    > Go away, go away, don't you come back any more! / Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door...

    > Last night I saw upon the stair, / A little man who wasn't there, / He wasn't there again today / Oh, how I wish he'd go away...
	

    * ...Creepy right? Anyway, that's how I decded on the poem, and then since you wanted it to be quite short, I only used the first stanza in my .aiff file. 
	
	
2. Using Terminal!
    * First, I didn't know how to save my .aiff file to this specific folder. I started fiddling around and jogging my brain to remember what 'cd' and 'pwd' meant and after I tried to get my computer to say a couple things and having random unusable file folders appear in my documents folder, I had a vague idea of what I needed to do. After getting a clearer idea of how to do it from my notes and from the GitHub class repository (I knew I wanted to type in 'cd' and then tell the computer exactly where to go and which files to look for but I didn't the format that it needed to be in), I went right to google and asked "How do I tell Terminal where to save my files?" [here.](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5757659?sortBy=rank)
	* After that, I looked at my notes from last class for this HW assignment about the format for making my computer say things to double check that I had everything right, and then I plugged everything in!
	* Honestly, I was expecting many many many things to go wrong, but when I went to my Haiku folder, everything was there! 
	
	Here's all my code:

3. Determined to make a pretty TextMate window 
    * After this, I decided to make sure I felt comfortable with TextMate by making sure it looked structured and well thought out. So I went to GitHub and found a very convenient TextMate Cheatsheet, and was off to the races (especially after looking into John Gruber's original spec). Hopefully my work paid off and this looks somewhat presentable! 
	
4. I tried a couple times to add an image into TextMate, but nothing was working even after I tried some of the code that John Gruber explained, so I'm going to wait for us to cover it in class. I was going to put in a little image saying "Thank you!" that was also a reference to The Magnus Archives, but I guess I'll just have to do it the old fashioned way... 

So Thank you!! :)
