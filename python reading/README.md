# Python Reading Assignment 


## Chapter 1: the way of the program

#### Old: 

I already knew what a program was from our class discussions and readings. I also knew about the difference between an integer and floating point number from class. 

#### New: 

I'm gonna be so real-- and this might sound silly-- but I didn't realize you had the option to download & install Python??? That was crazy to find out, though I'm sure I'll be using web pages for now. 



## Chapter 3: functions

#### Old: 

We've talked a lot about functions already so I knew how functions worked and that you can call the function by name and such. 

#### New: 

I learned the difference between void functions and fruitful functions. More specifically, I thought that the void function always returning None was interesting. Oh, I also liked the suggestion to use stack diagrams!! That was very neat. 



## Chapter 5: conditionals and recursion 

#### Old: 

We've learned about how to use modulos, boolean expressions, logical operators and more, so that was mostly review (with the exception of learning the specific ways you're supposed to write all of it in Python-- I just mean that the concepts are familiar).

#### New: 

Learned about elif being an abbreviation for else if. 
Learned more about stack diagrams specifically for recursive functions and that was very interesting. Also learning about keyboard input specifically for Python was cool. 



## Chapter 10: lists 

#### Old: 

We learned a lot about lists and variables in class, so the concepts and definitions in this chapter were review. 

#### New: 

The example on the state diagram for cheeses, numbers and empty was really informative. Yeah, I'm learning a lot about the different diagrams and how they can be applied to many different situations and I'm excited to do more with them in class / on my projects. 

Also, both of the sub chapters 10.5 and 10.6 were very informative, and I'll have to reference this page a lot when working on lists in Python-- there's a lot of new, Python-specific rules and methods. Also the new use of pop was interesting to learn about!!
